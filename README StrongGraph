We need to check whether the graph is strongly connected or not

A directed graph is strongly connected if we can go from a node to every other node in the graph. We use kosaraju's BFS algorithm.

1. Create a directed graph using adjacent matrix.
2. Start with the node of you're choice and perform breadth first search of the graph.
3. Check whether all the nodes in the graph are visited. If 'false' then the graph is not strongly connected. Return.
4. If not false then reverse all the edges of the graph.
5. Repeat 3.
6. If not false then the graph is strongly connected.
